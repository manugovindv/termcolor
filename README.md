# Termcolor

#### Termcolor is a library to easily add colors and format your output in any terminal.

To see the options available in your terminal, run 
```sh
make run
```
If your terminal supports 24bit colors, you can use rgb values to get any of the 16 million+ colors.

#### TODO:
- Add HSV type input
- Add unit testing
